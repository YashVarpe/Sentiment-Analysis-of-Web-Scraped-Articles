# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Web-Scraped-Articles
I applied for the position of Data Science Intern at a company. To check my skills they sent me an assignment. This solution got me to the next round of interviews.

This repository contains a sentiment analysis project that involves web scraping textual data from multiple URLs, cleaning the extracted text, performing text analysis to compute various sentiment-related variables and storing them in an Output Data Structure file. Both the sample Output Data Structure and calculated output files are provided in the repository.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to extract article content from given URLs and perform text analysis to calculate several key variables. The process includes data extraction, text cleaning, and sentiment analysis using Python.

Key Steps
  1. Data Extraction
  2. Text Cleaning
  3. Sentiment Analysis

Dependencies and steps on how to run the files are given in 'Instructions.pdf'

Results
The final results are stored in a CSV file that contains the computed variables for each article. You can verify the calculated data by comparing it with the Output Data Structure file.
